    <section title="Introduction">
		<t>
      Network slicing is a methodology to generically describe the logical partitioning 
      of network resources  associated with a service or an application. Network Slicing is considered very useful because there is a need to generically describe 
      diverse set of services and related resource requirements that can then be applied to
      any number or type of proposed, implemented and/or deployed technologies and associated
      devices. Some key applications which might benefit from the use of network slicing include:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>)</t>
          <t>Wholesale business VPN</t>
          <t>Network infrastructure sharing among the operators</t><t>NFV connectivity (Data Center Interconnect)</t>
        </list>
      <!-- KM: I am confused here. Do you want to say this for network transport slice or network slice in general?-->
      A network slice is composed of different endpoints and application specific connectivity between them. Transport network slices are a type of network slices that are created and managed with in the scope of transport networks (IP, MPLS, GMPLS). There is no concrete definition for network transport slices established or method to realize them.
      </t>
      <t>
      This document provides a definition of 'transport slice' in IETF, and describes considerations for realization of transport slices. In this document the term transport slice is used as short form for transport network slice.

    <section title="High level architecture of end-to-end network slicing">
      <t>
        An end-2-end (E2E) network slice is a complete network slice that provides a service in its entireity with a specific assurance to the customer. A transport slice concerns those assurance aspects only with in the transport networks.

    To illustrate the IETF definitions of both E2E network slice and transport slice, consider the network shown in <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>, where a network operator has an E2E network slice that traverses multiple technology-specific networks. Each of these networks might use any of a number of technologies, including IP, MPLS, Fiber-Optics (e.g. WDM, DWDM), Passive Optical Networking (PON), Microwave, etc.
      </t>
      <t>
    Each of these networks includes multiple (physical or virtual) nodes and may also provide network functions beyond simply carrying of technology-specific protocol data units. The types of nodes used in any of these networks may include:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Packet Switches (e.g. Routers, Bridges)</t>
        <t>Application servers</t>
        <t>Firewalls</t>
        <t>Radio Access Network (RAN) components</t>
        <t>Mobile Core componets</t>
        <t>Microwave transceivers</t>
        <t>Optical repeaters</t>
        <t>etc.</t></list>
      </t>
      <t>
    Each network may support different technology and an E2E netowrk slice is a combination of these networks. As an example:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Network 1 might contain multiple 5G RAN nodes connected to a few Cell Site Gateways (CSG) routers. </t>
        <t>Network 2 might have one or more layer-3 routers and layer-2 switches which may run on top on optical network.</t>
        <t>Network 3 might have a few 5G RAN nodes connecting to Passive Optical Network (PON) switches.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>

    To further clarify the concept of the E2E network slice, consider the network operator-z has various 
    customers. One of the customers, needs a separate and an independent E2E logical network 
    for a service (e.g. CCTV, autonomous driving, HD map etc.) and has a specific network SLA requirement (e.g. a secure connection with an E2E latency less than 5ms) from End User-x (EU-x) to End User-y (EU-y) to the other side. This E2E logical network is called an "E2E network slice".  A typical example of EU-x in 5G is the User equipment such as infotainment unit in the car, CCTV, Car for autonomous driving etc. and a typical example of EU-y in 5G is 5G application server, IMS etc.
      </t>
      <t>
    In <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/> we use the term "E2E network slice" to show the logical 
    network with requested SLA from EU-x to EU-y. It is important to consider that an "E2E network slice" is 
    associated with a customer and a service type (e.g. CCTV service, autonomous driving etc.).
      </t>
      <t>
        <!--KM: I think entire city is too large, you can say an area or zone -->
    For example, a customer "City of NY" would like to connect all its CCTV cameras for the entire city to one or more locations for viewing or collection. To this end, it requests local carrier - 'operator-z' in NY to create a new E2E network slice with a bandwidth no-less-than 10Mbps from each CCTV coverage area. In this case, a single E2E network slice will be created by the operator-z for customer "City of NY", service type of CCTV and requested bandwidth connecting all the CCTV camera zones to one or more control-centers for the collection of video data.
      </t>
      <t>
    It may also be possible that more than one customer and/or service types are associated with an E2E network slice.
        <!-- KM: some issues here. This example seems not very accurate
        I can see what you want to say but CCTV as a service is just video streaming service, it can be used by
        NYPD or traffic police for public safety and traffic violation - 2 different services
          I suggest to comment this line below for now. Later we should talk about service types - then add more.
        -->
    For instance, an E2E network slice is associated with not only to service type CCTV 
    but another service "Public Safety", i.e. NS ID 10 is used for two services for City of NY.

    <section title="IETF Definition and Scope of Transport slice">
      <section title="Defintion">
      <t>
    The IETF definition of a transport slice is as follows:
      </t>
      <t>
        A transport network slice is an abstract network topology connecting a number of endpoints, with an expected network service specified through a set of service level objectives.
      </t>
      <t>
    Note that multiple transport slices can be combined together into one transport slice, in that case each segment will be called transport subslice or transport subnet slice. The document will consistently use the term transport subslice. Use of service level objectives help to clearly describe different network resources and corresponding parameters neccessary to describe a service.
      </t>
      <t>
    Informally, a transport slice has a set of connections and various endpoints to form a logical network. The goal is to achieve specific SLO for a customer as shown in  <xref target="fig_Transport-NS"/>. The endpoints maybe any physical or virtual network functions (PNF/VNF) or any network service for that matter. Simillarly connections maybe virtual or physicals links of any type of technology.  
      </t>

      <t>
      Referring to <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>, when operator-z creates a specific E2E network slice, it should create 
      one or more of the following two types of artefacts:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Transport slice (or transport sub-slices)</t>
        <t>Other slice (application logic or other non-IETF slice components)</t>
        </list>
	  </t>
      <t>
     As shown in <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>, an E2E network slice might have one or more of "Transport Slices" 
     and one or more of other slices of any combinations. One of the critical parts of an E2E network slice is 
     "Transport Slices" which provides various connections with certain SLA between various endpoints. 
      </t>
      <t>
     Defining the other slices is out-of-scope of current work.
      </t>
      <t><xref target="fig_Transport-NS"/> illustrates the definition of a Transport Slice where a single transport 
      slice provides connectivity between "m" endpoints on left-hand side to "n" endpoints on right-hand side with specific 
      characteristic for Service Level Agreement (SLA). 
      </t>
      <t>
      Each transport slice has the following main characteristics:
		  <list style="symbols">
			  <t>Transport slice definition: It addresses a set of technology-agnostic connections between 
				  various endpoints with certain SLA </t>
			  <t> Transport slice realization: In addition to its definition, a Transport Slice has a realization in 
				  the operator's network. Unlike transport slice definition, which is technology agnostics, its realization 
				  is technology specific.  </t>

      In addition to its definition, a Transport Slice has another characteristic which is its realization in the operator's network as shown in <xref target="fig_Implementation_TS"/>. The creaton of a new Transport Slice will be initiated from a northbound interface whereby a higher level system can request connections with specific characteristics (Step 1). This request will be processed by a Transport Slice Controller (Step 2) which specifies a mapping between northbound request to any IETF Services, Tunnels and paths. A series of requests for creaton of services, tunnels and paths will be sent to the network to realize the trasport slice.

Step 1: 
 The higher level system (e.g. e2e network slice orchestrator) 
 can request a transport slice with specific characteristics

Step 2:
 The transport slice controller maps the northboud request to 
 any IETF Services/Tunnels/Paths models

Step 3: 
 Realize the transport slice by creating Services/Tunnels/Paths

        <t><xref target="fig_Imple-5G-Transport-NS"/> depicts the realization of the transport slice 20 of <xref target="fig_5G-Transport-NS"/>. Operator's transport slice controller invoke an abstract API to create a transport slice between 5G endpoints gNB1 and gNB2 to 5G Core endpoints UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3 with SLA inlcuding 10 [ms] latency. 
        </t>
        <t>
      Since in most cases the passed in endpoints (i.e. 5G RAN and 5G Core endpoints) cannot support any IP/MPLS/Optics services, the endpoints to realize the transport slice 20 will not be the endpoints passed in. This is one of the most important aspects to consider when realizing the transport slices.  
        </t>
        <t>
      As shown in <xref target="fig_Imple-5G-Transport-NS"/>, the realization of transport slice 20 required the transport slice 
      controller to find out the "best" endpoints which support the realization of transport slice 20 in the
      network, i.e. endpoints ER1, ER2 and ER3. After that, the realization of the transport slice 
      20 will be initiated by creation of various services/tunnels/paths between edge routers ER1,
      ER2 and ER3. The type of Services/Tunnels/Paths depends on the supported technologies of endpoints ER1, ER2 and ER3.
        </t>
        <t>
      In this scenario, the end points of transport slice realization are not those endpoints passed in, i.e.

      <section title="Realization of Scenario-2">
        <t><xref target="fig_Imple-Transport-NS"/> depicts the realization of transport 
      slice 30 of <xref target="fig_FW-Transport-NS"/>. Operator's Transport Slice Controller receives a request to create a 
      transport slice between network functions R1 and firewalls FW1 and FW2 with SLA including 5 [Mbps]. 
      Depends on the underlying network topology, Operator's transport slice controller will realize the transport slice. For example, if both network functions (i.e. R1, FW1, FW2) 
      and network supports segment routing, two Tunnels/Services of type SR can be created (or used) in the 
      network between R1, FW1 and FW2 to realise the transport slice 30. However, if the network just supports
      RSVP, two tunnels/services of type RSVP can be used to realize this transport slice. 
        </t>
        <t>
      Note that since the network functions ER1, FW1 and FW2 support segment routing, the endpoints of 
      the tunnels in this example are those endpointss passed in, i.e. the endpoints of the both transport slice definiton and its realization are R1, FW1 and FW2:
      <list style="symbols"><t>Definition of transport slice is between network functions R1 to FW1 and FW2</t><t>Realization of transport slice is between network functions R1 to FW1 and FW2</t></list>
        </t>
        <t>
      We will see in next example that in some scenarios this is not the case and the endpoints of 
      Transport Slice definition might be different from endpoints of its realization of transport slices. 
        </t>
        <t>
      It is very clear that regardless of how transport slice is realized in the network (i.e. using tunnels 
      of type RSVP or SR), the definition of transport slice 30 does not change at all but rather its realization.

        <t><xref target="fig_Imple-SFC-Transport-NS-1"/> depicts the realization of the transport slice 40 of 
      <xref target="fig_SFC-Transport-NS-1"/> where a transport slice needed between network functions R1 and R2 across SF1 
      and SF2. However, the location of SF1 and SF2 are decided internally with a logic in Transport Slice Controller. For example, when SLA requires the high secure transport slice between ER1 and ER2 which in turn results on adding SF1 and SF2 to the realization of transport slice 40 implicitly by transport slice controller.

        <t><xref target="fig_Imple-SFC-Transport-NS-2"/> shows the realization of the transport slice 40 of

      level logic. In this case three transport slices 41, 42 and 43 will be created separately and eventually bind 
      together to form a single transport slice 40 to meet the SLA that delay is lower than 30 ms.
